It notes, in particular, that the domestic courts endorsed the findings made by psychiatric expert J., in line with the previous findings of another psychiatric expert, that the applicant suffered from a dissocial and schizoid personality disorder as defined by the ICD-10. That disorder was of a sufficiently serious nature, had manifested itself in the serious offences including rape of randomly chosen victims committed by him and necessitated specific therapeutic treatment. Moreover, in view of the high risk that the applicant would commit further similar serious offences if released, the applicant\u2019s mental disorder was shown to be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, which, furthermore, depended upon the persistence of that disorder. The applicant was therefore a person \u201cof unsound mind\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e).",

It observes that during the period here at issue, the applicant was initially detained, from 9 April 2012 (when he had served ten years in preventive detention) until January 2013, in a separate department for persons in preventive detention in Schwalmstadt Prison. The Court, referring to its established case-law in this respect (see, inter alia, O.H. v. , no. 4646/08, \u00a7\u00a7 87-92, 24 November 2011; Kronfeldner v. , no. 21906/09, \u00a7\u00a7 80-85, 19 January 2012; and Glien v. Germany, no. 7345/12, \u00a7\u00a7 92 et seq., 28 November 2013), finds that during the time in which the applicant was detained in Schwalmstadt Prison in the said department, he had not been remanded in an institution suitable for the detention of mental health patients.",

In the latter institution, the conditions of detention for persons in preventive detention and the offers of therapy were gradually improved so as to comply with the requirements of the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act. Having regard to the material before it, the Court observes that in the applicant\u2019s case, there was a considerable change in the institutional setting, the general staffing situation particularly in the psychology service and concerning specific offers of therapy made to the applicant in order to address his mental disorder. In particular, the applicant was repeatedly invited to participate in a sex offender treatment programme in May 2013. The Court can therefore accept that from May 2013 onwards, the applicant was offered the therapeutic environment appropriate for a person detained for being of unsound mind in the building on the premises of Weiterstadt Prison and was thus detained in a suitable institution for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) (compare also Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 118-128).",

It notes, in particular, that the domestic courts endorsed the findings made by psychiatric expert J., in line with the previous findings of another psychiatric expert, that the applicant suffered from a dissocial and schizoid personality disorder as defined by the ICD-10. That disorder was of a sufficiently serious nature, had manifested itself in the serious offences including rape of randomly chosen victims committed by him and necessitated specific therapeutic treatment. Moreover, in view of the high risk that the applicant would commit further similar serious offences if released, the applicant\u2019s mental disorder was shown to be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, which, furthermore, depended upon the persistence of that disorder. The applicant was therefore a person \u201cof unsound mind\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e).",

As for the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention at issue, ordered under Article 67d \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 4 May 2011, the Court, having regard to the requirements established in its case-law (see paragraph 30 above), must examine whether that detention was effected in a hospital, clinic or other appropriate institution for mental health patients. It observes that during the period here at issue, the applicant was initially detained, from 9 April 2012 (when he had served ten years in preventive detention) until January 2013, in a separate department for persons in preventive detention in Schwalmstadt Prison. The Court, referring to its established case-law in this respect (see, inter alia, O.H. v. , no. 4646/08, \u00a7\u00a7 87-92, 24 November 2011; Kronfeldner v. , no. 21906/09, \u00a7\u00a7 80-85, 19 January 2012; and Glien v. Germany, no. 7345/12, \u00a7\u00a7 92 et seq., 28 November 2013), finds that during the time in which the applicant was detained in Schwalmstadt Prison in the said department, he had not been remanded in an institution suitable for the detention of mental health patients.",

From January 2013 until a fresh periodic review decision extending the applicant\u2019s preventive detention was taken on 18 November 2013, the applicant was detained in a separate building for persons in preventive detention on the premises of Weiterstadt Prison. In the latter institution, the conditions of detention for persons in preventive detention and the offers of therapy were gradually improved so as to comply with the requirements of the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act. Having regard to the material before it, the Court observes that in the applicant\u2019s case, there was a considerable change in the institutional setting, the general staffing situation particularly in the psychology service and concerning specific offers of therapy made to the applicant in order to address his mental disorder. In particular, the applicant was repeatedly invited to participate in a sex offender treatment programme in May 2013. The Court can therefore accept that from May 2013 onwards, the applicant was offered the therapeutic environment appropriate for a person detained for being of unsound mind in the building on the premises of Weiterstadt Prison and was thus detained in a suitable institution for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) (compare also Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 118-128).",

As regards the nature of the preventive detention measure in the present case, the Court, having regard to its above findings (see paragraphs 32-33), notes that between 9 April 2012 and May 2013, the applicant\u2019s preventive detention was executed in prison under conditions which did not yet permit the conclusion that the focus of the measure lay on the applicant\u2019s medical and therapeutic treatment as a mental health patient. In contrast, from May 2013 onwards, the applicant was detained in Weiterstadt in an institutional setting and under conditions offering him sufficiently individualised care and specific and comprehensive therapy addressing his mental condition, including a sex offender treatment programme.",
